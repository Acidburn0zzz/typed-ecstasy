**Please be aware:**

This port is in an early stage. It still needs to be optimized, especially for memory (no pooling yet).

A tiny entity framework written in TypeScript. It started as a port of the C++ [Entity Component System](https://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/game-programming/understanding-component-entity-systems-r3013)
[ecstasy](https://github.com/lusito/ecstasy), which is a port of [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/)
from LibGDX. typed-ecstasy is a high-performance entity framework  without the use of black-magic and thus making the API easy
and transparent to use.

Automated unit tests are running on [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
